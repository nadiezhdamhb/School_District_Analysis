# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Prepare and analyze all standardized test data from a school district for analysis, reporting and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.
These insights are to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. 

Analyze data on student funding and student's standardized test scores (Math and reading) and various information on school's they attend
Task: Aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets
and priorities. While working on this task, we'll need to mantain the data confidential as part of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 which
protects the privacy of student education records. 
Additionally the school district provided that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested for updated data summaries.

After analyzing the data, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School instead of removing them because this will provide the best accuracy while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

The Math and Reading scores were replaced with "NaN", which means a "Not-a-Number" value resulting in a closer representation of the original data.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
